## 🌐 METAMASK BROWSER TESTING:

### What Happens:
1. Tool opens your chosen browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
2. Goes to MetaMask website
3. Shows you EXACT instructions for each valid word
4. You manually test each word in MetaMask
5. The one that opens your real wallet is CORRECT!

### Why This is Better:
- **OLD WAY**: Tool found "valid" word but was wrong for your actual wallet
- **NEW WAY**: Tests against your ACTUAL wallet in MetaMask
- **RESULT**: Find the word that actually opens YOUR specific wallet

## 🔍 FINDING ALL VALID COMBINATIONS:

### Example Results:
```
RESULT #1: Position 22: 'abandon' ← Test this first
RESULT #2: Position 22: 'ability' ← Test this if #1 fails  
RESULT #3: Position 22: 'about'   ← Test this if #2 fails
...etc
```

### Testing Process:
1. Start with Result #1 - test in MetaMask
2. If it opens your wallet → DONE! ✅
3. If it fails → Try Result #2
4. Continue until you find YOUR specific wallet
