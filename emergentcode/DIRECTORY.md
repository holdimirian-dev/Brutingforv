## 🆘 HAVING PROBLEMS?

### Python Issues:
1. **Read `PYTHON_FIX.md`** first

3. **Worst case**: Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked

### Tool Issues:
1. **Read `USER_GUIDE.md`** - Contains detailed troubleshooting
2. **Try test data first** - Click "Load Test Data" in the GUI
3. **Check your words** - Make sure they're spelled exactly right
4. **Verify positions** - Ensure words are in correct positions

## 🎯 REMEMBER THE GOLDEN RULES:

1. **Position 22 stays EMPTY** - That's what we're finding
2. **Enter 23 words** - In their exact positions (skip 22)
3. **Check spelling** - Every word must be perfect
4. **Be patient** - Recovery can take a few minutes

**Good luck recovering your mnemonic! 🍀**
