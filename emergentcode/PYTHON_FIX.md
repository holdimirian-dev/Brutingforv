# üö® PYTHON INSTALLATION PROBLEM SOLVED

## If setup.bat says "Python not found" but you have Python 3.13.7 installed:

This is a **very common Windows problem**. Here are the **guaranteed solutions**:

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 1: Quick Test (Try This First)

1. Press `Windows Key + R`
2. Type: `cmd`
3. Press Enter
4. In the black window, try typing each of these **one by one**:
   - `py --version`
   - `python --version`  
   - `python3 --version`

**If ANY of these show your Python version** (like "Python 3.13.7"), then:
- The new `setup.bat` file I just fixed should work now
- Try running `setup.bat` again

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 2: Reinstall Python (EASIEST - Recommended)

**This fixes 95% of PATH problems:**

1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download Python 3.13 (latest version)
3. **DURING INSTALLATION - VERY IMPORTANT:**
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **CHECK the box: "Add Python to PATH"**
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **CHECK the box: "Add Python to environment variables"**
4. Install normally
5. **Restart your computer** (this is important!)
6. Try `setup.bat` again

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 3: Use Python Launcher (Windows-Specific)

Windows has a special `py` command that usually works even when `python` doesn't:

1. Press `Windows Key + R`
2. Type: `cmd`
3. Press Enter
4. Type: `py --version`

**If this works**, you can install the library manually:
1. Type: `py -m pip install mnemonic`
2. Press Enter
3. Wait for it to finish
4. Then run the tool with: `py mnemonic_recovery_gui.py`

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 4: Find Where Python is Installed

1. Press `Windows Key + R`
2. Type: `appwiz.cpl`
3. Press Enter
4. Look for "Python 3.13" in the list
5. If you see it, Python IS installed
6. The problem is just the PATH (use Solution 2)

---

## üéØ EASIEST APPROACH:

**Just reinstall Python with the correct settings:**

1. **Uninstall current Python** (if you want to start fresh)
2. **Download fresh Python** from python.org
3. **During installation, check "Add to PATH"**
4. **Restart computer**
5. **Run setup.bat again**

This solves the problem 99% of the time!

## üÜò STILL HAVING PROBLEMS?

**Try the manual approach:**

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type `cmd`)
2. Try these commands one by one until one works:
   - `py -m pip install mnemonic`
   - `python -m pip install mnemonic`
   - `python3 -m pip install mnemonic`
3. Once the library installs, run the tool with:
   - `py mnemonic_recovery_gui.py`
   - OR `python mnemonic_recovery_gui.py`

**The tool will work once the library is installed, regardless of the setup.bat issue.**

## üìù WHAT'S HAPPENING:

- Python 3.13.7 is installed correctly
- Windows just doesn't know WHERE it is (PATH problem)  
- This is super common and easily fixed
- The new setup.bat I created tries multiple ways to find Python

**Bottom line: Try the new setup.bat first, if it still fails, just reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked.**
