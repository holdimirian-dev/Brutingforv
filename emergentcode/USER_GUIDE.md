- Double-click `mnemonic_recovery_gui.py`
- A window will open with 24 numbered boxes

### Entering Your Words

#### üéØ THE GOLDEN RULE:

- Leave position 22 EMPTY (this is what we're finding)
- Position 22 will be grayed out and show "[MISSING]"

#### Example:
If your mnemonic is: `word1 word2 word3... word21 [MISSING] word23 word24`

1. Type `word1` in box 1
2. Type `word2` in box 2
3. Continue until box 21
4. **SKIP BOX 22** (leave empty - it's disabled)
5. Type `word23` in box 23
6. Type `word24` in box 24

### Starting Recovery
1. After entering all 23 words, click "üîç Start Recovery"
2. The tool will automatically test all 2048 possible BIP39 words
3. Watch the progress bar and messages in the results area
4. **BE PATIENT** - this can take a few minutes

### When Recovery Completes
- ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**: You'll see the missing word and complete mnemonic
- ‚ùå **FAILED**: Double-check your words are correct and in right positions

## USING WITH YOUR LEDGER DEVICE

### Option 1: Test the Recovered Mnemonic
1. **NEVER enter your real mnemonic directly into MetaMask on a connected computer**
2. After recovery, write the complete mnemonic on paper
3. Use Ledger Live to restore your wallet with the complete mnemonic
4. Verify the addresses match your expected wallet

### Option 2: Safer Method (Recommended)
1. Use the recovered mnemonic to restore your Ledger device
2. Set up the Ledger as new with the complete mnemonic
3. Connect Ledger to MetaMask as hardware wallet
4. This keeps your mnemonic secure in the hardware device

---

## TESTING THE TOOL (Recommended First Step)

### Before Using Your Real Words:
1. Click "üß™ Load Test Data" button
2. This loads a test mnemonic with known missing word
3. Click "üîç Start Recovery"
4. It should find the missing word "abandon" quickly
5. This confirms the tool works correctly

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### ‚ùå "Invalid Word" Error
- **Problem**: One of your words isn't in the BIP39 wordlist
- **Solution**: Check spelling carefully. Words must be exact BIP39 words

### ‚ùå "Too Many Empty Positions" Error
- **Problem**: You left more than just position 22 empty
- **Solution**: Fill in all boxes except 22

### ‚ùå "Wrong Empty Position" Error
- **Problem**: You left a position other than 22 empty
- **Solution**: Only position 22 should be empty

### ‚ùå Tool Won't Start
- **Problem**: Python or mnemonic library not installed
- **Solution**: Run `setup.bat` or manually install: `pip install mnemonic`

### ‚ùå "No Valid Mnemonic Found"
Possible causes:
1. **Wrong word positions**: Verify each word is in its correct position
2. **Spelling errors**: Double-check every word
3. **Wrong missing position**: Maybe it's not position 22 that's missing
4. **Damaged mnemonic**: The original might have more errors
